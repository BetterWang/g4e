## INTRODUCTION



		
## List of the built-in histograms

    1.   number of (tracking) steps/event
    2.   energy deposit distribution in the absorber (in MeV)
    3.   angle distribution of the primary particle at the exit
         of the absorber (deg)
    4.   distribution of the lateral displacement at exit(mm)
    5.   kinetic energy of the transmitted primaries (MeV)
    6.   angle distribution of the backscattered primaries (deg)
    7.   kinetic energy of the backscattered primary particles (MeV)
    8.   kinetic energy of the charged secondary particles (MeV)
    9.   z distribution of the secondary charged vertices (mm)
    10.   kinetic energy of the photons escaping the absorber (MeV)
