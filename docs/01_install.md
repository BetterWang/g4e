# Build/Install

## Spack install
Spack is a package management tool designed to support multiple versions and configurations of 
software on a wide variety of platforms and environments. Spack allows to automatically build
target packages with all needed dependencies. [Sapck documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#installation)

The installation consist of 3 steps then:
1. Install spack itself
2. Install EIC [repository](https://github.com/eic/eic-spack) (with EIC packages)
3. Run spack command to install g4e (or other packages)


### Install spack and EIC repository

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git

#Source environment

# For bash/zsh users
$ . spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh

# For tcsh/csh users
$ source spack/share/spack/setup-env.csh
```

You should be able now to use spack:

```bash
spack info root
```

> (!) By default, all packages will be downloaded, built and installed in this spack directory
>
[More documentation on spack installation](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#installation)


Clone and add [eic-spack repository](https://github.com/eic/eic-spack):

```bash
# Adding the EIC Spack Repository
git clone https://github.com/eic/eic-spack.git

# Add this repository to your Spack configuration
spack repo add eic-spack
```


### Install and use g4e with spack

To install g4e with spack (this will install the latest stable version)

```bash
spack install g4e
```

To install concrete version of spack:

```bash
spack info g4e            # to see the available versions
spack install g4e@1.3.7   # 
```

To see what is going to be installed/built

```bash
spack speck -I g4e
```

To use G4E with spack:

```bash
spack load g4e

# or with exact version
spack load g4e@1.3.7
```

## CMake build

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/jlab-eic/g4e.git
mkdir g4e/build
cd g4e/build
cmake -DGEANT4_DIR=<geant4 installation> ../
make
```

### Dependencies

- **Geant4**
   - CMake flag: `GEANT4_DIR`   
- **VGM**  
   Provides export to CERN.ROOT geometry
   - Env. variable: `VGM_DIRECTORY` or `VGM_DIR`
   - CMake flag: `VGM_DIRECTORY`
- **HEPMC2**
    Required to open Pythia8 and other HepMC2 compatible MC files   
   - Env. variable: `HEPMC_DIR` or `HEPMC_ROOT_DIR`
   - CMake flag: `HEPMC_DIRECTORY` or `HEPMC_DIR`
- **Cern ROOT**  
   Required for IO and some histogramming
   - Environment variable: `ROOTSYS`
   - CMake flag: `CERN_ROOT_DIRECTORY`


### CMake flags

Additional flags:
`WITH_GEANT4_UIVIS` = ON Build with Geant4 UI and Vis drivers. Default
`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` = 11 - C++ standard used.

## Use ejpm (obsolete)

> EJPM is still available and mantained but further development is 
> concentrated around Spack packet manager

ejpm is EIC software centric package/build manager. It is the designed
to be the default tool to build G4E on users machine, as it helps with:

- building dependent packages (with "right" compilation flags)
- setup environment variables to run everything 
- what packages to install by system packet manager
- rebuild/update/remove/clean existing packages

> Still, ejpm is not a requirement. 

First, install ejpm itself:

```bash
pip install --user ejpm
```
(If you have certificate problems (JLab issue), don't have pip, or have other problems, 
[here is the detailed documentation](https://gitlab.com/eic/ejpm) )

Install g4e and possible other EIC packets (ejana, eic-smear, etc.)
```bash
# 1. System prerequesties
ejpm req centos g4e      # get list of required OS packets. Use `ubuntu` on debian  
sudo yum install ...     # install watever 'ejpm req' tells you

# 2. Where to install
ejpm --top-dir=<where-to>   # Directory where packets will be installed

# 3. Install
ejpm install g4e            # install 'Geant 4 EIC' and dependencies (like vgm, hepmc)

# 4.  Source environment
source ~/.local/share/ejpm/env.sh  # Use *.csh file for tcsh
```

You have ROOT and Geant4 and don't want EJPM to build them?  
(Use your installations of ROOT and Geant4)

```
# Before running 'ejpm install g4e'
ejpm set root `$ROOTSYS`    # Path to ROOT installation
ejpm set geant <path>       # Path to Geant4 installation   
```

Hint (!). Run ejpm to overview all installed packets, environment and status by 'ejpm' command

Here is the sample output:  
```
> ejpm

EJPM v0.01.19
top dir :
    /eic
state db :
    ~/.local/share/ejpm/db.json  (users are encouraged to inspect/edit it)
env files :
    ~/.local/share/ejpm/env.sh
    ~/.local/share/ejpm/env.csh
