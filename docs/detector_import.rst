Adding a detector
=================


> The word "detector" is ambiguous. To solve this, in this text and code we try to use
"subdetector" for if "detector" which is a single part of an
experimental setup we name it . When "detector" is used to identify the overall experimental setup
we will use "main detector" term.

In order to maintain many subdetectors G4E tries to isolate each individual subdetector
